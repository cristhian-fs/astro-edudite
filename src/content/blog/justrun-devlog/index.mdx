# Introduction

JustRun is a webapp built for runners who wants to improve their performance along their workout periodization. I talk more about it on the [Project Introduction](/projects/justrun), please check it out!

## Development diary list

This is a list of sub-blogs where I post development diaries every time I develop something. I'll try to post frequently, at the time I'm writing this post, I've already build a lot of things that I didn't document. Sorry about that -_-, but I'll try to try to explain how the app works as long as I do more code, I promise :)
